    To lead a better life, I need my love to be here


    Here, making each day of the year
    Changing my life with a wave of her hand
    Nobody can deny that there's something there


    There, running my hands through her hair
    Both of us thinking how good it can be
    Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

    I want her everywhere
    And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
    But to love her is to need her everywhere
    Knowing that love is to share
    Each one believing that love never dies
    Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there


    I want her everywhere
    And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
    But to love her is to need her everywhere
    Knowing that love is to share
    Each one believing that love never dies

    Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there


    I will be there and everywhere
    Here, there, and everywhere
